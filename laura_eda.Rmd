## Organizing factors

```{r}

```

```{r, fig.width=10}
heart %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = heart_disease_mortality_per_100k, y = metro, height=..density..)) +

Bimodal distribution for "urban population of 20,000 or more"

    "Counties in metro areas of 250,000 to 1 million population", 
    "Counties in metro areas of fewer than 250,000 population", 
    "Urban population of 20,000 or more, adjacent to a metro area", 
    "Urban population of 20,000 or more, not adjacent to a metro area",

  rename(metro_ruccs = metro, 
         population_ruccs = population,
         urban_influence = area__urban_influence)

heart %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = heart_disease_mortality_per_100k, x = population_ruccs, fill = metro_ruccs)) +

heart %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = heart_disease_mortality_per_100k, x = urban_influence, fill = metro_ruccs)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip()

heart <- heart %>% 
  rename(economic_typology = econ__economic_typology) %>% 
  mutate(economic_typology = factor(economic_typology),
         economic_typology = fct_inorder(economic_typology)) 

heart %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = heart_disease_mortality_per_100k, x = economic_typology, fill = metro_ruccs)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip()

```

Not a huge consistent effect for these area and economic typologies.


```{r}
heart <- heart %>% 
  mutate(pure_population = fct_collapse(population_ruccs, "> 1,000,000" = "Metro > 1 million",
                                        "250,000 - 1,000,000" = "Metro 250k - 1 million",
                                        "< 250,000" = "Metro <250k",
                                        ">20,000" = c("Urban >20,000 metro-adjacent", "Urban >20,000 metro non-adjacent"),
                                        "2,500 - <20,000" = c("Urban 2,500-19,999 metro-adjacent", "Urban 2,500-19,999 metro non-adjacent"),
                                        "< 2,500" = c("Rural metro-adjacent", "Rural metro non-adjacent")),
         metro_adjacency = fct_collapse(population_ruccs, metro = c("Metro > 1 million", "Metro 250k - 1 million", "Metro <250k"),
                                        adjacent = c("Urban >20,000 metro-adjacent", "Urban 2,500-19,999 metro-adjacent", "Rural metro-adjacent"),
                                        nonadjacent = c("Urban >20,000 metro non-adjacent", "Urban 2,500-19,999 metro non-adjacent", "Rural metro non-adjacent")))

heart %>% 
  select(pure_population, metro_adjacency)

heart %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = heart_disease_mortality_per_100k, y = pure_population, fill = metro_ruccs, height=..density..)) +
  geom_joy(scale = 0.85)

heart %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = heart_disease_mortality_per_100k, y = pure_population, fill = urban_influence, height=..density..)) +
  geom_joy(scale = 0.85, alpha = 0.3)

##sample size of what's shown above?
heart %>% group_by(urban_influence, pure_population) %>% 
  summarize(count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(count) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
##yup outliers


heart %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = heart_disease_mortality_per_100k, y = metro_adjacency, fill = urban_influence, height=..density..)) +
  geom_joy(scale = 0.85, alpha = 0.3) 
```

would it be worth it to test with these collapsed factors? metro_adjacency simply functions as a collapsing of the urban_influence variable.

there's some possible interaction on pure_population with urban influence at the small population levels but it's probably a result of small sample size

## Done with Factors! onto continuous predictors

```{r, fig.width = 10}
str_remove_hlth <- function(x) {
  str_remove(x, pattern = "health__")
}

substring = function (x) {str_sub(x, start = -20)}

#Within category correlation
heart %>% 
  select_if(is.numeric) %>% 
  select(starts_with("econ")) %>% 
  rename_all(substring) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  cor() %>% 
  corrplot::corrplot(method = "ellipse")

heart %>% 
  select_if(is.numeric) %>% 
  select(starts_with("demo")) %>% 
  rename_all(substring) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  cor() %>% 
  corrplot::corrplot(method = "ellipse")

heart %>% 
  select_if(is.numeric) %>% 
  select(starts_with("health")) %>% 
  rename_all(substring) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  cor() %>% 
  corrplot::corrplot(method = "ellipse")

heart$eco
```

Health statistics related to healthy behaviors are highly intercorrelated: obesity, smoking, diabetes, low birthweight babies, excessive drinking, and physical inactivity. Less so are more environment- or "acts of God"-related health behaviors: particulate matter, homocides, motor vehicle crashes, and rates of dentists and doctors (though the last two are highly correlated).

For demography, there's some categorical variables masquerading as separate predictors, leading to high intercorrelation within those categories: percentages of residents who are a given race accounts for 5 variables; age-related bins (less than 18, greater than 65) account for 2 variables; birth and death rate; and percentages of residents who complete a given level of education account for 4 variables.

For economics, unsurprisingly, the percent of adults and the percent of children without health insurance  are highly correlated, as well as percent civilian labor and unemployment rate.

*Overall*: we have a large amount of multicollinearity, and ideally lasso and ridge will allow us to reduce the number of variables who are poorer predictors. I would predict ridge to do well here.

## Correlation with predictor

```{r}
cor_matrix <- heart %>% 
  select_if(is.numeric) %>% 
  select(-row_id) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  cor()

cor_tibble = as_tibble(cor_matrix)

heart_attacks_cor = tibble(variable = names(cor_tibble),
                     correlation = cor_tibble$heart_disease_mortality_per_100k)

heart_attacks_cor %>% 
  arrange(desc(abs(correlation)))

heart_attacks_cor %>% 
  arrange(abs(correlation))

heart_attacks_cor %>% knitr::kable()
```

Above are the most highly-correlated variables with our outcome, and the least-correlated.

## New data export

```{r}
write_csv(heart, "./data/laura_test_version.csv")
```

## Missing data !!! 

missing data is a big deal for analysis

```{r}
heart <- read_csv("./data/laura_test_version.csv") %>% 
  select(-row_id)

skimr::skim(heart)

```
