```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(modelr)

```

```{r}
heart <- read_rds("./data/train_imputed.Rdata") 

x <- model.matrix(heart_disease_mortality_per_100k ~ ., data = heartRDS)[,-1]
y <- heart$heart_disease_mortality_per_100k

```

Set up `caret` training control. We will use this for all models.

```{r}
set.seed(100)
ctrl1 <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 10, repeats = 5)
```

## Ridge

Cross validate to find the optimal lambda value.

```{r}
set.seed(100)

ridge_fit <- train(x, y,
                     method = "glmnet",
                     tuneGrid = expand.grid(alpha = 0, 
                                            lambda = exp(seq(-2, 10, length = 200))),
                    trControl = ctrl1)


plot(ridge_fit, xTrans = function(x) log(x)) #in correct range

best_lambda_ridge = ridge_fit$bestTune$lambda 

summary(ridge_fit$finalModel)

##centered, scaled coefficients from caret
predict(ridge_fit$finalModel, s = best_lambda_ridge, type="coefficients") %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  arrange(desc(abs(value))) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

#saving caret object to rdata
saveRDS(ridge_fit, "ridge.rds")

```

Our best lambda is `r best_lambda_ridge`, but it's not an entirely stable value because RMSE does not differ substantially in the range; that is, glm chooses a different value: 

```{r}
#Using Glmnet for visualization 
ridge_cv_glmnet <- cv.glmnet(x, y, 
                      alpha = 0, 
                      lambda = exp(seq(-2, 10, length = 200)), 
                      type.measure = "mse")

plot(ridge_cv_glmnet, xvar = "lambda", label = TRUE)

plotmo::plot_glmnet(ridge_cv_glmnet$glmnet.fit, xvar = "lambda")
abline(v = log(best_lambda_ridge), col = "blue")

ridge_cv_table <- tibble(lambda_values = ridge_cv_glmnet$lambda, mse = ridge_cv_glmnet$cvm, mse_upper = ridge_cv_glmnet$cvup, mse_lower = ridge_cv_glmnet$cvlo)

##MSE
ridge_cv_table_best <- ridge_cv_table %>% 
  arrange(mse) %>% 
  slice(which.min(abs(lambda_values - best_lambda_ridge)))

ridge_mse_plot <- ridge_cv_table %>% 
  filter(lambda_values %in% exp(seq(-2, 5, length = 200))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log(lambda_values), y = mse)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(aes(x = log(best_lambda_ridge), y = ridge_cv_table_best$mse), color = "red") +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = mse_lower, ymax = mse_upper), alpha = 0.3)
  
ridge_mse_plot + annotate("text", x = 0.5 + log(best_lambda_ridge), y = 1.05*ridge_cv_table_best$mse, label = "Lambda chosen by caret", color = "red")
#for fun
```

We can see that all coefficients shrank, but none really shrank to 0. Ridge was not very effective at eliminating coefficients among values of candidate coefficients.

## MARS

We next create a piecewise linear model using multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS).
```{r, echo = T, message = FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
library(pdp)
library(earth)
library(vip)
library(patchwork)
```
Since there are two tuning parameters associated with the MARS model: the degree of interactions and the number of retained terms, we need to perform a grid search to identify the optimal combination of these hyperparameters that minimize prediction error.

```{r}
set.seed(2)

mars_grid <- expand.grid(degree = 1:3, 
                         nprune = 10:40) #degree: 1 vs 2 vs 3, no interaction vs. interaction;
#nprune is number of coef

set.seed(2)
mars_fit <- train(x, y,
                 method = "earth",
                 tuneGrid = mars_grid,
                 trControl = ctrl1)

ggplot(mars_fit)

mars_fit$bestTune

mars_fit$finalModel$gcv #metric earth uses to choose

#saving caret object to rdata
saveRDS(mars_fit, "mars.rds")
set.seed(2)

mars_grid_refined <- expand.grid(degree = 2, 
                         nprune = 25:40) 
mars_fit_refined <- train(x, y,
                 method = "earth",
                 tuneGrid = mars_grid_refined,
                 trControl = ctrl1)

ggplot(mars_fit_refined)

mars_fit_refined$bestTune
summary(mars_fit_refined$finalModel)

mars_fit_refined$finalModel$gcv #metric earth uses to choose

#saving caret object to rdata
saveRDS(mars_fit_refined, "mars2.rds")

```

To better understand the relationship between these features and `heart_disease_mortality_per_100k`, we can create partial dependence plots (PDPs) for each feature individually and also an interaction PDP. This is used to examine the marginal effects of predictors.

A nice way to visualize especially these black box models. We see that the model fitted by MARS gives a smaller cross validation error, because we're carefully tuning those nonlinear terms.

```{r}
#Variable importance
vip::vip(mars_fit_refined, num_features = 55, bar = FALSE, value = "gcv") + ggtitle("GCV")
vip::vip(mars_fit_refined, num_features = 55, bar = FALSE, value = "rss") + ggtitle("RSS")

#Final coefficients: interactions
coef(mars_fit_refined$finalModel) %>%
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable()

#Partial feature plots
p1 <- pdp::partial(mars_fit, pred.var = c("health__pct_physical_inacticity"), grid.resolution = 10) %>% autoplot()
p2 <- pdp::partial(mars_fit, pred.var = c("demo__pct_aged_65_years_and_older"), grid.resolution = 10) %>% autoplot()
p3 <- pdp::partial(mars_fit, pred.var = c("health__pct_physical_inacticity", "demo__pct_aged_65_years_and_older"), grid.resolution = 10) %>%  plotPartial(levelplot = FALSE, zlab = "yhat", drape = TRUE, colorkey = TRUE, screen = list(z = -20, x = -60))

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 3)
```


## Ridge and MARS comparison
```{r}
set.seed(100)
summary(resamples(list(
  ridge = ridge_fit,
  MARS = mars_fit)))$statistics$RMSE
```


On average, the MARS fit is slightly better.
